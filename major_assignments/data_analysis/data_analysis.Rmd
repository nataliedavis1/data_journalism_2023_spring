```{r}
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(corrr)

spotify_youtube <- read_csv("data/Spotify_Youtube.csv")%>%
clean_names()

spotify_youtube <- spotify_youtube %>%
  mutate(minute_run = duration_ms / 60000) 
```


```{r}

# Question 1. How does the amount of energy within the music compare to the number of views the song has 

correlation_df <- spotify_youtube %>%
  filter(!is.na(energy)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(views)) %>% 
  mutate(views_energy = energy / views) %>%
  mutate(correlation = cor (energy, views))

correlation <- cor(correlation_df$energy, correlation_df$views)

print(correlation)


# For this question our finding was that the correlation number here shows there is not a significant correlation between the two categories. This is an interesting finding to us because we had initially thought that the higher energy a video had the more excited we would personally be to view it. In our experiences as music listeners, we often associate our listening habits as repeatedly going back to songs that have higher energy and wanting to listen to those songs again and again. From our experience as listeners, lower energy songs do not have the same level of replay-ability. This could make for an interesting story if we looked deeper into why this data set doesn’t point to an existing correlation. The next step that we took was looking further into what energy could be correlated to, which we will answer in question 2.
```
```{r}
cor.test(correlation_df$energy, correlation_df$views)

spotify_youtube %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x=energy,y=views)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x=energy,y=views), method="lm")
```



```{r}
#Question 2: Is there a connection between the energy and the valence (mood) of the song?
spotify_youtube <- spotify_youtube %>%
  mutate(minute_run = duration_ms / 60000) %>%
  mutate(minute_val_ratio = valence/minute_run)
  
correlation_df_minuteval <- spotify_youtube %>%
  filter(!is.na(valence)) %>%
  filter(!is.na(energy)) %>%
   mutate(correlation = cor (valence, energy))


correlation <- cor(correlation_df_minuteval$valence, correlation_df_minuteval$energy)

print(correlation)
  
#For this question our finding was that there ended up being a stronger correlation between energy and valence. The r number of 0.39 here was much stronger than the correlation between energy and views. This positive correlation suggests that when songs have a more positive valence than usually the energy of that song is going to be more upbeat as opposed to a song with a negative valence which will usually have a lower energy level. This is an interesting finding because people who are turning on a playlist may want to know more about how the valence that they are listening to impacts the overall energy of the song. If we were to make a story using this finding, we would want to look at music genres that contradict this pattern in the data. For example, we were thinking about the metal music genre. Usually that genre has negative valence when it comes to its lyrics, however the music itself is very high energy. There are potentially other genres that fit that same category and looking deeper into why people might enjoy this kind of juxtaposition could give some insight into the music industry and how genre’s differ from one another.

# Question 3. What key is most frequent within the top 20 most streamed songs? What about within all of the songs?
```


```{r}
top20<- spotify_youtube %>%
  arrange(desc(stream))
head (25)
  top20_cleaned <- top20[c (-5, -8, -11, -13, -23), ]
```


```{r}
spotify_youtube %>%
  group_by(key)%>%
  summarise(total_key = n()) %>%
  mutate(pct= total_key / 20718 *100 ) %>%
  arrange (desc(total_key)) 
  
# The most common keys are C# (1), G (7) and D (2). These keys occur 5, 3 and 2 times respectively. Since the C# key occurs five times, our major finding is that the C# key is occurring about 25% of the time within the top 20 most streamed songs. Of all the songs, the most common is C which occurs 11% of the time. It is interesting to note though that  the C# key is nearly twice as common within the top 20 most streamed songs as it is within all (10% as compared to 25%).This could be because writers have noticed that songs in this key do well, or sound good so they strive to write hit songs in that key. For this story it would be interesting to look more into what exactly makes up a hit song as key could definitely play a factor in a song being more popular. Within our story we would want to pitch that we should interview songwriters with the hopes of creating a hit and ask them what goes into their decision making process and whether or not they heavily consider a song’s key before creating their song.

# Question 4. What level of loudness is the most frequent among the top 20 streamed songs? 
top_20 <- spotify_youtube %>%
    arrange(desc(stream))%>%
    head(25)
    top20_cleaned <- top_20[c (-5, -8, -11, -13, -23), ]

top20_loudness <- top20_cleaned%>%
  group_by(loudness)%>%
  summarise(total_loudness = n()) %>%
  arrange (desc(total_loudness))

loudness_rounded <- top20_cleaned %>%
  mutate( loudness_rounded = round(loudness, 0)) %>%
    group_by(loudness_rounded)%>%
  summarise(total_loudness_rounded = n()) %>%
  arrange (desc(total_loudness_rounded))

top20_cleaned %>%
  mutate( loudness_rounded = round(loudness, 0)) %>%
    group_by(loudness_rounded)%>%
  summarise(total_loudness_rounded = n()) %>%
  mutate(pct= total_loudness_rounded/ 20 *100 ) %>%
  arrange (desc(total_loudness_rounded))


# The most common level of loudness among the top 20 streamed songs is -6, -7 and -5.These key's occur 8, 4 and 2 times respectively. Since 8 out of the 20 most streamed songs have a loudness of -6, this occurs about 40% of the time. We could not figure out how loud that actually is because when we researched decibels, the measuring unit, it was a completely different scale than our data set had it as. However, this is an interesting finding because nearly half of the top 20 streamed songs in the data have the same loudness level. It would be interesting to look into why this is, if it has anything to do with the hit song production process, or if people who are streaming songs are more inclined to listen to songs within this level of loudness.

```{r}
# Question 5: Of the top 20 most streamed songs, which song has the highest like to view ratio?

spotify_youtube %>%
  mutate(like_views = likes / views * 100) %>%
  arrange(desc(like_views))

#The top 4 songs that have the highest like to view ratio are all by the same artist called j-hope. These songs all have a 20% plus like to view ratio, meaning that 20% of the people who watched the video have given it a like. Although they have high like to view ratios, these are not this artist highest ranked according to the Billboard charts which is interesting because it could mean that this artist's fans could potentially be the ones who are giving these songs a like. J-hope is a part of a South Korean boy band called BTS which is known for having fans that were particularly dedicated to the members of the group. The band had a heavy fangirl culture both within South Korea and internationally. It would be interesting to focus a story around talking to fangirls and seeing their thoughts on why some songs resonate within just the fandom as opposed to other songs that resonate more broadly.

1. Loads and cleans the core data set to prepare for analysis.

We used the cleannames() function to get rid of unnecessary spaces in the column names. 


 2. Shows basic exploratory analysis to demonstrate an understanding of the dataset, including the number of rows and columns, any obvious limitations or flaws and any reasons why it might not be able to answer the questions you've posted last week. 


In this dataset there are 20,718 rows (different songs) with 21 columns (mostly different categories to break down the songs, though some are links). There aren’t any obvious flaws that stand out to us at the moment. 

A big limitation is that the data does not tell us the date that songs came out. This is important to know because it could be unfair to compare a song that just came out to one that’s been out for years and the two are not actually equal. This data also doesn’t tell us the peak height that a song reached on the Hot 100 Billboard charts which could be interesting to be aware of. It would be a bit hard to define what “popular” means outside of this metric, but for our case we will try to find a dataset that we think fits it to the best of our ability. 

3. Describe the limits of the data in terms of timeframe, what is and is not included and any codes or other information you'd need to find definitions for, and what you've done to better define it.

The data was collected Feb 7, 2023. So right off the bat any songs that were released after that are not on the list and any songs that gained popularity after that are not reflected properly to the numbers of today.. For the most part all the data is understandable and we wouldn’t need to search for the definitions of it. The only term that I was unfamiliar with was “valence” but after a quick google search I learned that it means musical positiveness conveyed by a track.
